## 🗃️ Problem Scenario: 
Without problem nothing is impossible. All system has some problems. we also face some problems in real life and we will try to solve this.
We can recapitulate a problem here:
* People do not have complete trust in online systems; hence they do not reap the full benefits of these systems.
* There is a manual mechanism for order, but it is all done online.
* Using a variety of platforms may not be sufficient for all user.
The system can be accessed at any time and from any location. This system is highly straightforward and user-friendly; a few examples are:
* There is huge collection of donor.
* Anyone can get blood on time.
* Smart way of appointment.
* Can upload prescription for future
* Reduce cost
* Best courses
* Can know acceptability by rating and many more.

## 💡 Challenges: 
Reliability and satisfaction is the main factor of a perfect website. Our main challenges are to ensure the reliability and satisfaction to the user. However, choosing a suitable platform and relying on hardware is an important issue. These Projects have been created for the Bangladeshi Patient and Doctors help assistance.
Every job has its own set of difficulties. As a result, we must also face a modest number of challenges.
* Because it's a Web-based system, folks that ought to build appointments and
bookings on-line victimization any web-connected device (computer, laptop,
sensible phone, tablet, etc.) would be unable to try and do so.
* If a user fails to review the notification for confirmation of a booking, the
system's main goal will be failed. 

For this we perfectly maintain those requirements:

* UI and UX design
* Security
* Performance
* Authorization
* Scalability
   
    
## 🔥 Motivation
Suppose I am 52 years old now. Now I like to travel SINGAPORE. I am not familiar with online searching. But now I use this website which can provide best offer gathered by admin. From this scenario, we realize how can it help me. As a student I need to develop my skills and sometimes I need to go to travel for refreshment. That’s all I can get by using this application. Reading blogs is best practice now. It also in our application. The system also has a blood donor module, which allows users to register for blood donations and locate blood groups for future use. One can request for blood, donate blood. Blood for humanity.
